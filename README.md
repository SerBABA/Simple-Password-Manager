# Simple-Password-Manager

A on going project to learn how password managers work. However, currently learning about implementation of a
MVC architecture from my studies. This project uses a similar communication method, as webpages communicate with REST APIs.

The project is eventual goal is to be able to be easily converted into a web-based application, which will allow for storage
of user information and accounts associated with the user.

The project is based on a original project I have created in 12/03/2019 while looking for a password manager. This lead to the idea
of creating my own. However, it is not intended to be used as it is simply a learning experience!

- This project does not include the library files I have written for this project.
